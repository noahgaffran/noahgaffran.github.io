									<h2>Boreal Bear - 3.5" Nitrous/Alcohol liquid</h2>
									<p>Noah Gaffran & Thomas Fairhead</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Thomas Fairhead, from Waterloo Rocketry, approached me about collaborating on a liquid rocket project back in fall 2024. Over the following half a year, we designed and built Boreal Bear, a 3.5" diameter nitrous/alcohol monotube liquid rocket. Thomas focused on the engine side while I handled the airframe, recovery, and electronics, although there was plenty of crossover on all aspects of the rocket. While we didn't have enough time at the busy Launch Canada 2025 to test and fly it, Thomas completed a test fire in September 2025 and a first flight for the rocket is on the horizon.

										<h4>Engine</h4>
									</header>
									<p>
										The main valve uses just a single moving part. This smart valve design was pioneered by a fellow from Germany named Roman. We liked its simplicity and Thomas designed a modified version for this project. The nitrous fills through a poppet with a check valve, and the fill pressure keeps the valve closed. When the igniter bursts the fill hose, the loss of pressure opens the valve for both propellants. The main valve and injector assembly were SLS 3D pritned from aluminum, with post machining by Thomas.

									</p>
									<p>
										The chamber is a smaller diamter aluminum tube with a paper phenolic ablative thermal liner. The throat is graphite, and the rear closure, which also functions as both a tailcone and a nozzle expansion cone extension, is aluminum. All these parts were machined by Thomas.

										<h4>Ground Support Equipment</h4>

									<p>
										The GSE box is a near 1:1 copy of the Half Cat design for Mojave Sphinx. We appreciate the wonderful documentation provided by Half Cat that allows other rocketeers like us to follow in their footsteps. Since our rocket has no need for electrically activated valves on the rocket itself, we were able to use one of the plug outlets for the ignition leads and the other for the battery power.

										<h4>Airframe</h4>
									</header>
									<p>
										The fins were made from carbon fibre plate surplus from Waterloo rocketry. Thomas and I made the fin can tube ourselves from carbon fibre fabric roll wrapped on a mandrel. The nosecone was made by me from fibreglass sleeve on a 3D printed mold. The nosecone attaches to the rocket onto a coupler built into the forward tank bulkhead. This coupler also houses the avionics bay on a printed sled.

										<h4>Recovery</h4>
									</header>
									<p>
										I made a custom 4 foot diameter 10 gore elliptical main parachute for Boreal Bear. It has kevlar shroud lines for fire resistance to the ejection charges. The drogue is an off-the-shelf parachute from Top Flight. The recovery is single separation, with cable cutters for main parachtue release.

										<h4>Testing</h4>
									</header>
									<p>
										Thomas completed a test firing on October 5, 2025.
